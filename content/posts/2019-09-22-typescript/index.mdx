# Learn TypeScript

I decide to learn `TypeScript` after read some articles. This blog is build using `TypeScript`, I see in `JavaScript` communities many discussion about `TypeScript`, Ben Awad recommend `TypeScript`, Prisma example docs is using `TypeScript`, and so on.

At first I was afraid learning `TypeScript` will distracting of my main focus to mastering `JavaScript` and `React`. [Robin Wieruch](https://robinwieruch.de) on his blog (I forgot his blog's title and it still have no Search input yet -- waiting for `GatsbyJS`) give an advice to new developer in `React` to not learn `TypeScript` until they have a good skill in `EcmaScript`.

I don't have an idea about my recent skill (you tell me), but I'm not the new developer anymore. Before I learn `JavaScript`, I was learning `Golang` which it has more complex data-type than `TypeScript`. You can read my historical dirty-hand on [this repo](https://github.com/alfieqashwa/gobyexample). Yes, it's just basic. But it's enough for me to know `JavaScript` is bundling all `uint8` and `int8` to 64, `float32`, 64, `complex64` and `complex128` in just `number data-type`. Even though `TypeScript`.

So, I'm starting to learn `TypeScript`, but still, it's not my main focus until now. My starting goal is just _not getting confused whenever i found typescript syntax code_.

I start create -- converting actually -- a basic todos app and deploy on [my sub-domain site](https://typescript.alfieqashwa.me) where I put the code on [this repo](https://github.com/alfieqashwa/react-typescript).

And yeah, I'm using `CRA --typescript` instead of `Gatsby`, because after learn `Gatsby` I forgot about how `React Router`, LoL. But I'll start again.

... sappy weekend !

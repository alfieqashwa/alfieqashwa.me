# Learn TypeScript

After read some articles, I decide to learn `TypeScript`. This blog is build using `TypeScript`, I see in `JavaScript` communities there are so many discussion about `TypeScript`; Ben Awad recommend to learn `TypeScript`, Prisma example tutorial is using `TypeScript`, and so on.

At first I was doubt that learning `TypeScript` would distracting my main focus to mastering `JavaScript` and `React`. [Robin Wieruch](https://robinwieruch.de) on his blog was advicing for new developers in `React` to not learn `TypeScript` *yet* until they have good skill in `EcmaScript`. He's absolutely right. It took me  sometime to realize about the important things to stay focus. In the world where we can `googling` what we want and easily reading random articles mention by our mobile phone's notification, stay focus on something is really hard. Too many distraction on the internet.

I was learning `Golang` before `JavaScript`. `Go` has more complex data-types than `TypeScript`. If you read [my repo](https://github.com/alfieqashwa/gobyexample), even though that was just basic exercises where I was dirty my hand, but it's quite enough for me to know that `TypeScript` bundle all of the `uint8 and int8 to 64, float32, 64, complex64 and complex128` in just *number data-type*.

So I start to learn `TypeScript`. My starting goal -- with small step -- is _not getting confused whenever i found typescript syntax. <span role="img" aria-label="sheep">😅</span>

I created -- converted actually -- a basic todos app deploy on [my sub-domain site](https://typescript.alfieqashwa.me). The code is on [this repo](https://github.com/alfieqashwa/react-typescript). There will be more.

I use `CRA --typescript` instead of `Gatsby`, because after few months learning `Gatsby` I forgot about how `React Router`'s works. <span role="img" aria-label="sheep">😅</span>.

I'm starting over again.

... sappy weekend !
